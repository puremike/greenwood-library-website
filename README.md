#Greenwood Community Library Website
Welcome to the README.md file for the Greenwood Community Library Website project.

##Project Overview

You're part of a development team tasked with enhancing the website for the "Greenwood Community Library. " The website aims to be more engaging and informative for its visitors. It currently includes basic sections: Home, About Us, Events, and Contact Us. Your team decides to add a "Book Reviews" section and update the "Events" page to feature upcoming community events.

You will simulate the roles of two contributors: "Morgan" and "Jamiet". Morgan will focus on adding the "Book Reviews" section, while Jamie will update the "Events" page with new community events.
